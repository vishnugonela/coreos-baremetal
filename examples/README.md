# Examples

These examples network boot and provision machines into CoreOS clusters using `bootcfg`. You can re-use their profiles to provision your own physical machines.

## Tutorials

Get started running `bootcfg` on your Linux machine to network boot and provision clusters of VMs or physical hardware.

* [bootcfg with rkt](../Documentation/getting-started-rkt.md)
* [bootcfg with Docker](../Documentation/getting-started-docker.md)
* [Kubernetes v1.2.4](../Documentation/kubernetes.md)
* [Self-hosted Kubernetes](../Documentation/bootkube.md) (experimental)

## Experimental

These examples demonstrate booting and provisioning various (often experimental) CoreOS clusters. They have **NOT** been hardened for production yet. You should write or adapt Ignition configs to suit your needs and hardware.

## SSH Keys

Most examples allow `ssh_authorized_keys` to be added for the `core` user as machine group metadata.

    # /var/lib/bootcfg/groups/default.json
    {
        "name": "Example Machine Group",
        "profile": "pxe",
        "metadata": {
            "ssh_authorized_keys": ["ssh-rsa pub-key-goes-here"]
        }
    }

## Conditional Variables

### "pxe"

Some examples check the `pxe` variable to determine whether to create a `/dev/sda1` filesystem and partition for PXEing with `root=/dev/sda1` ("pxe":"true") or to write files to the existing filesystem on `/dev/disk/by-label/ROOT` ("pxe":"false").

### "skip_networkd"

Some examples (mainly Kubernetes examples) check the `skip_networkd` variable to determine whether to skip configuring networkd. When `true`, the default networkd config is used, which uses DCHP to setup networking. Use this if you've pre-configured static IP mappings for Kubernetes nodes in your DHCP server. Otherwise, `networkd_address`, `networkd_dns`, and `networkd_gateway` machine metadata are used to populate a networkd configuration on each host.
